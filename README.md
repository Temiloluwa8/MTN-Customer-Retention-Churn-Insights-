# MTN-Customer-Retention-Churn-Insights-
Insightful Power BI report on MTN’s customer churn, satisfaction, and revenue impact.
## Project Overview
This Power BI project provides deep insights into MTN’s customer retention and churn trends.  
It identifies why customers leave, which demographics are most affected, and how satisfaction levels and devices influence retention.  
The dashboard helps business teams make data-backed decisions to reduce churn and boost revenue.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was provided by the school where I work, as part of an internal data analytics exercise.
It contains anonymized customer information modeled to simulate MTN’s customer churn and retention data for learning and project purposes.
## Importance of the Project
Customer churn directly impacts a company’s profitability, especially in the highly competitive telecom industry.
This project is important because it:
+ Helps identify key drivers of customer loss, such as poor network quality or high data costs.
+ Provides data-backed insights for developing retention strategies.
+ Enables MTN or similar organizations to monitor churn trends and respond proactively.
+ Demonstrates how data visualization and analytics can translate raw data into actionable business decisions.

## Tool Used
+ Power BI – Used for data cleaning, transformation, modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design.

## Data Overview
The dataset contains customer information used to analyze churn behavior and retention performance.
It includes both demographic and behavioral data, allowing for a deeper understanding of customer trends and satisfaction levels.
### Key Columns in the Dataset:
1. Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer
2. Gender: Male or Female
3. Age Group: Categorized age brackets (e.g., 18–25, 26–35, 36–45, etc.)
4. Device Type: SIM, Broadband, or Router users
5. Satisfaction Rate: Customer rating on a scale of 1–5
6. Revenue: Total revenue generated per customer
7. Churn Status: Indicates if the customer has churned or not
8. Reason for Churn: Explanation for customer loss (e.g., poor network, high cost)
9. Month: The month associated with each churn record
## Analysis Breakdown
The analysis was carried out in Power BI following a structured, end-to-end process:
### Data Loading & Cleaning
+ Imported the dataset into Power BI.
+ Removed duplicates and blank records.
+ Ensured data types (numeric, text, date) were correctly assigned.
### Data Transformation
+ Standardized column names for consistency.
+ Created new calculated columns (e.g., Age Group).
+ Handled missing satisfaction values using average ratings.
### Data Modeling
+ Built relationships where necessary.
+ Created DAX measures for key metrics such as:
   + Total Customers
   + Churned Customers
   + Churn Rate (%)
   + Total Revenue
   + Churned Revenue
### Exploratory Analysis
+ Examined churn by age group, gender, and device type.
+ Identified top reasons for churn.
+ Analyzed the impact of satisfaction rate on churn behavior.
### Dashboard Development
+ Designed interactive visuals to highlight key insights.
+ Used KPIs, bar charts, and slicers for better storytelling.
+ Applied clean, minimal formatting for professional presentation.
### Insight Generation
+ Discovered that churn was highest among customers aged 36–45.
+ Found a direct relationship between low satisfaction and high churn.
+ Identified poor network quality and costly plans as major churn drivers.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was provided by the school where I work, as part of an internal data analytics exercise.
It contains anonymized customer information modeled to simulate MTN’s customer churn and retention data for learning and project purposes.
## Importance of the Project
Customer churn directly impacts a company’s profitability, especially in the highly competitive telecom industry.
This project is important because it:
+ Helps identify key drivers of customer loss, such as poor network quality or high data costs.
+ Provides data-backed insights for developing retention strategies.
+ Enables MTN or similar organizations to monitor churn trends and respond proactively.
+ Demonstrates how data visualization and analytics can translate raw data into actionable business decisions.

## Tool Used
+ Power BI – Used for data cleaning, transformation, modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design.

## Data Overview
The dataset contains customer information used to analyze churn behavior and retention performance.
It includes both demographic and behavioral data, allowing for a deeper understanding of customer trends and satisfaction levels.
### Key Columns in the Dataset:
1. Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer
2. Gender: Male or Female
3. Age Group: Categorized age brackets (e.g., 18–25, 26–35, 36–45, etc.)

8. Reason for Churn: Explanation for customer loss (e.g., poor network, high cost)
9. Month: The month associated with each churn record
## Analysis Breakdown
The analysis was carried out in Power BI following a structured, end-to-end process:
### Data Loading & Cleaning
+ Imported the dataset into Power BI.
+ Removed duplicates and blank records.
+ Ensured data types (numeric, text, date) were correctly assigned.
### Data Transformation
+ Standardized column names for consistency.
+ Created new calculated columns (e.g., Age Group).
+ Handled missing satisfaction values using average ratings.
### Data Modeling
+ Built relationships where necessary.
+ Created DAX measures for key metrics such as:
   + Total Customers
   + Churned Customers
   + Churn Rate (%)
   + Total Revenue
   + Churned Revenue
### Exploratory Analysis
+ Examined churn by age group, gender, and device type.
+ Identified top reasons for churn.

+ Used KPIs, bar charts, and slicers for better storytelling.
+ Applied clean, minimal formatting for professional presentation.
### Insight Generation
+ Discovered that churn was highest among customers aged 36–45.
+ Found a direct relationship between low satisfaction and high churn.
+ Identified poor network quality and costly plans as major churn drivers.
